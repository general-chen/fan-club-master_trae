The icon loading issue is resolved. The logs confirm that the official project icons (`fan_icon.png` and `fan_icon.ico`) are being successfully loaded from `D:\wesklake\research\postdoc\exp_set_up\fan_array\fan_code\fan-club-master_trae\master\resources\icons\`. The code changes to locate and load these icons, including the Windows taskbar ID fix, are verified and working correctly.

I will now close this task as the user's request to "continue debugging" after the icon mismatch report has been addressed by replacing the icons with the official ones and verifying the load process. The program is running successfully with the correct icons.
